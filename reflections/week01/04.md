## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
to get a rough idea on what you want your site/app to look like, without committing to one thing
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
LoFi: very primitive mockups that are mainly for giving rough ideas
MidFi: a slightly more descriptive mockup that conveys a bit more than lowfi
HiFi: a very detailed mockup that basically shows what the final product should look like
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
In most cases, yes, I think wire-frames are worth investing into, but for me personally, I enjoy improvising and letting ideas flow out naturally

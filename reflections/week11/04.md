## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


I feel like this has been a great experience for me, I've learned a lot (especially with taking the hirst half of the course twice), and I know this is the career path I'm going for. I feel I still have to learn some time management skills as I do tend to burn myself out with long periods of coding with no breaks. My most joyful moments have been the "AHA" moments I get when I overcome a bottleneck in my code.

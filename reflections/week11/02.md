## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

     A `primary key` is a unique identifier for a row in a table
     A `foreign key` is a unique identifier for a row in another table

2. What is an `Alias`?
      An `Alias` is a name that can be used to refer to a table in a query

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
```
public List<Patient> GetPatients(int doctorId)
{
  SELECT
  d.*,
  p.*
  FROM doctors d
  JOIN patients p
    ON d.id = p.doctorId
  WHERE d.id = doctorId

 
}

```

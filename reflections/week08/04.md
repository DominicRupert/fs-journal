## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
end to end testing
it gives you an oppurtunity to see the results of what your users will see when using your application
unit testing
unit testing allows you to test individual pieces of code, and then you can refactor them to make them better
component testing
component testing allows you to see how code will affect the DOM and how it will look
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think component and end to end testing are most practical as it shows you the closest thing to a real user experience
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
unit testing seems like it has the least return on investment, as it is more time consuming and less accurate
